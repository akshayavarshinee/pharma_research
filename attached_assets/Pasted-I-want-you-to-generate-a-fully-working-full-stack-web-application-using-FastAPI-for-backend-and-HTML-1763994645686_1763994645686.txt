I want you to generate a fully working full-stack web application using FastAPI for backend and HTML + Tailwind + Vanilla JS for the frontend.

This web application is for pharma research. The user enters natural-language questions about the pharmaceutical industry. The backend will later be extended with AI “agents” that fetch pharma data from APIs — but RIGHT NOW, I only need the frontend + backend structure, including user accounts and pages.

✔ Requirements
Frontend

Create a frontend with the following pages:

Landing page

Button: “Sign In / Create Account”

Sign Up page

Email

Password

Confirm password

Store in database (hashed)

Login page

Email

Password

Validate using stored hashed passwords

Set session cookie or JWT

Chat Query Page

Minimal clean chat-like UI

A single text input

“Generate Report” button

On submit: POST the question to the backend

Display a loading animation

Redirect to the results page when backend returns a report ID

Results Page

Fetch stored result using /results/{id}

Display:

Report title

Generated textual report

Space for visualizations (placeholder divs)

User should be able to:

Download as PDF

Save report

Go back to chat

Use TailwindCSS for styling.
Include a static/ folder for CSS/JS and a templates/ folder for HTML (Jinja2).

✔ Backend: FastAPI

Build a FastAPI backend with the following structure:

backend/
 ├── app/
 │   ├── main.py
 │   ├── auth/
 │   │    ├── routes.py
 │   │    ├── hashing.py
 │   │    ├── jwt_handler.py
 │   ├── users/
 │   │    ├── models.py
 │   │    ├── routes.py
 │   ├── queries/
 │   │    ├── models.py
 │   │    ├── routes.py
 │   ├── results/
 │   │    ├── models.py
 │   │    ├── routes.py
 │   ├── database.py
 │   └── templates/
 ├── static/
 ├── requirements.txt

Backend Features

User authentication

JWT-based auth (access + refresh tokens)

Password hashing with bcrypt

User management

Register

Login

Get user profile

Each user can have multiple stored queries + reports

Query submission endpoint
POST /query/

Body: { "question": "string" }

Create a query record in DB

Return: { "report_id": <id> }

For now, generate dummy placeholder reports, not real API results.

Report storage

Store:

user_id

question

timestamp

generated_report_text

placeholder for charts

Report retrieval endpoint
GET /results/{id}

PDF export endpoint
GET /results/{id}/pdf

Database

Use SQLAlchemy

SQLite for local use

✔ The application must follow:

Clean folder structure

Pydantic schemas

SQLAlchemy models

Jinja2 template rendering

Static folder for CSS/JS

Tailwind integration

Commented code

Ready for extension with agents + pharma APIs later

✔ Deliverables:

Generate:

All backend code

All models/schemas

Routes

Authentication logic

Database setup

HTML templates

Tailwind config

A README explaining how to run it locally

Dummy report generation function
