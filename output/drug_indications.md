## Clinical Development Status
- **Approved Indications**: 10 (major indications related to reproductive and gynecological cancers)
- **Investigational Uses**: 2 (ongoing trials for related cancers typically involve Bevacizumab)
- **Clinical phases** span from investigational to approved uses in various cancers, demonstrating Bevacizumab’s efficacy in oncological therapies relevant to reproductive health.

## Repurposing Opportunities
Bevacizumab has notable efficacy in various cancers, including those impacting reproductive organs. Given the normal use of Bevacizumab as an anti-angiogenic agent, its potential to be repurposed for high burden reproductive conditions can be investigated further, particularly concerning diseases like endometrial cancer and ovarian cancers, where existing treatment options can be enhanced with additional anti-angiogenic strategies.
